                            I have a PhD in Rehabilitation Technology program from the department of Kinesiology and Community Health of University of
                            Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My undergraduate degree is in Food science and nutrition and I
                            have a Master degree in Kinesiology (Kinesmetrics). My thesis was focused on Modern Assistive
                            Technology abandonment among people with disabilities. I love using modern technology to make
                            life more comfortable and am enthusiastic about designing cellphone application for improving
                            the quality of life of people with disabilities.
